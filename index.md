## Test Results

Homebrew is used in the installation of Ruby and Jekyll on a local computer.  This allows a user to launch a Jekyll server to view the edits to website content.

Jekyll/Ruby are components of GitHub.  A user can edit and view contents and then use Git (or Git Desktop if you don't want to remember more commands) to move the content to GitHub.  It is possible to do all edits in a repository on GitHub and not need to do the installation of Ruby/Jekyll on a local computer.

### Minima Theme
From my research, this is the one theme that will allow adding of menu items within the header area of the page (e.g. the 'About' menu item).  There is an option to control which pages appear in this navigation and also the order of the terms.
